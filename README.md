## **Abou t me**

This might be the only CV you read of a dev who's written script for React, MongoDB and Graham Norton. I am a recent graduate of the mighty Makers Academy software development bootcamp but my background is working in the TV and Radio industry as a comedy writer and programme development producer.

I have written gags for many high-profile TV series, sketches for big name performers and have created original TV programmes, radio shows and podcasts. Wanting a new challenge, I am now applying my creative thinking, problem-solving and obesssion with syntax to software development.

 I've put 'Full Stack Software Developer' rather grandly at the top there :arrow_up: and, sure, I have learned a **huge** amount during 16 weeks of bootcamp but I can't pretend to be a seasoned engineer. I can say though, without any hesitation, that I love coding, learning new skills and working in teams of smart people building machines out of words. 

:computer: ## **Projects**
| Project | Description | Technologies |
|---  |---  |---  |
| [**Final Project**](https://github.com/sirdavy) | Our Makers final project. Built to....  | NodeJS, ExpressJS, React, HTML, CSS, Spotify Web API, Google Natural Language Sentiment API and Google Cloud Vision API |
| [**Acebook**](https://github.com/sirdavy/acebook-team-water) | During this group project, we were asked to create a Facebook clone. During this project we focused on agile working styles and how they fit into our teams as well as understanding how to build our first React project.

:sparkles: ## Skills
* Creative Thinker - "Well, that's half an hour of my life I'll never get back". It's a familiar phrase I must have heard someone else say, and it went through my head after being cut off while on hold to the bank. But it made me think; what if you could get a temporal refund on all the time-sucks in your life? And that is now the premise of a podcast I've created for Audible. However, between that first thought and the recording, there has been a lot of creative heavy-lifting - fleshing out the format, writing up and designing a pitch deck, making changes after feedback. XXX There's a lot of creative work XXXXX between idea and execution. Being able to keep my mind open to ideas - a kind of focussed day-dream state of mind - and then getting down to the nitty-gritty of writing and rewriting is something I'm very comfortable with.  

Creative thinking - a kind of focussed, day-dream state of mind - is one thing but then getting down to the nitty-gritty creative work of writing and rewriting is something I'm very comfortable with. [ref to working on group projects]

* Communicator - I write scripts and devise television show formats for a living but I also have to sell or ‘pitch’ these ideas face-to-face with producers and commissioners in a persuasive manner. With this experience I feel confident in saying that not only do I have good written and verbal skills I also know how to read the room and get the right tone. And articulate often complex ideas in an persuasive manner. 

* Teamwork - There's a famous tenet in improv comedy, that when a performer begins building a premise on stage their fellow perfomers should react with a “yes, and” response - "yes" meaning "I'm going to run with this" and the "and" adds to that idea. Whenever I've worked on a show in a writer's room or with a development team from another production company it can be a bit of a creative scrum, lots of thoughts get pitched in and often there'll be a idea which seems to conflict logically with main project. It's in these situations I've always tried to adopt a "yes, and" mindset. It doesn't mean, at the end of a session, each idea is equal in strength, but you don't know how strong an idea might be until you've given it some 'yes, and' as a group.

* Attention to detail - Part of working as a writer is problem solving, being able to look at an idea analytically and figure out why it’s not working or how it can be improved. I have written scripts, rewritten them and rewritten them, that is the process - constant improvement. It builds a habit of meticulousness and attention to detail; a word in the wrong place and a joke loses its punch, a typo in some dialogue and a scene doesn’t make sense.
  
* Working to a brief - It's often the case I'll turn up in the morning to work on a new show, be given a brief by the producer and be expected to hand over pages of material by the end of the day. It's a high pressure stuff. Briefs for shows, however, can range from very detailed outlines to vague, hand-wavy stuff, and for each case, in order to deliver work that's on target, I am very experienced at asking the right questions, taking the temperature, and getting a feel for what a client really wants.
