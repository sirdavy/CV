## <a name="about_me"> About me </a>

This might be the only CV you read of a dev who has written script for React, MongoDB and Graham Norton. I am a graduate of the mighty Makers Academy software development bootcamp but my background is working in the TV and Radio industry as a comedy writer and programme development producer.

I have written gags for many high-profile TV series, sketches for big name performers and have created original TV programmes, radio shows and podcasts. Wanting a new challenge, I am now applying my creative thinking, problem-solving and obesssion with syntax to software development.

 Sure, I've put 'Full Stack Software Developer' rather grandly at the top there :arrow_up:, and I have learned a **huge** amount during 16 weeks of bootcamp but I can't pretend to be a seasoned engineer. I can say, without any hesitation that I love coding, learning new skills and working in teams of smart people building machines out of words.
